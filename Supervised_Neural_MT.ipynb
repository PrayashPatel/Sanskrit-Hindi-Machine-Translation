That wise person becomes immortal whom these (situations) do not trouble and to whom the pleasure and pain are eal.', ' Birth (or existence) does not happen to what is non-existent, and destruction (or non-existence) to what is existent; the finality of these two has been seen by the seers of the reality.', ' And know That to be destructionsless, by Which all this (universe) is pervaded; no one is capable of causing destruction to this changeless One.', ' These physical bodies that have an end and suffer the peculiar destruction, are declared to belong to the eternal embodied Soul, Which is destructionless and imcomprehensible.

This is unborn, destructionless, eternal and ancient and is not slain [even] when the body is slain.', ' Whosever realises This to be changeless, destructionless, unborn and immutable, how can that person be slain; how can he either slay [any one] ? O son of Prtha !', ' Just as rejecting the tattered garments, a man takes other new ones, in the same way, rejecting the decayed bodies, the embodied (Self) rightly proceeds to other new ones.', ' Weapons do not cut This; fire does not burn This; water does not (make) This wet; and the wind does not make This dry.', ' This is not to be cut; This is not to be burnt; (This is) not to be made wet and not to be dried too; This is eternal, all-pervading, stable, immobile and eternal.', ' This is declared to be non-evident, imponderable, and unchangeable. Therefore understanding This as such you should not lament.', ' On the other hand, if you deem This as being born constantly or as dying constantly, even then, O mighty-armed one, you should not lament This.', ' Death is certain indeed for what is born; and birth is certain for what is dead. Therefore you should not lament over a thing that is unavoidable.', ' O descendant of Bharata !  The beings have an unmanifest beginning, manifest middle and certainly the unmanifest end. On that account why mourning?', ' This someone observes as a wonder; similarly another speaks of This as a wonder; another hears This as a wonder; but even after hearing, not even one understands This.', ' O descendant of Bharata ! This embodied One in the body of every one is for ever incapable of being slain. Therefore you should not lament over all beings.', ' Further, considering your own duty, you should not waver. Indeed, for a Ksatriya there exists no duty superior to fighting a righteous war.', ' O son of Prtha ! By good fortune, Ksatriyas, desirous of happiness, get a war of this type [to fight], which has come on its own accord and which is an open door to the heaven.', ' On the other hand, if you will not fight this righteous war then you shall incur the sin by avoiding your own duty and fame.', ' The creatures will speak of your endless ill-fame; and for the one who has been highly esteemed the illfame is worse than death.', ' The mighty charioteers will think of you as having withdrawn from the battle out of fear : having been highly regarded by these men, you shall be viewed lightly.', ' Slandering your ability, the enemies will talk of you many sayings that should not be talked of. Is there anything more painful than that ?', ' If you are slain you shall attain heaven; or if you coner, you shall enjoy the earth. Therefore, O son of Kunti ! stand up with resolution made in favour of [fighting] the battle.', ' Viewing alike, pleasure and pain, gain and loss, victory and defeat, you should get then ready for the battle. Thus you will not incur sin.', ' Listen, how this knowledge, imparted [to you] for your sankhya, is [also] for the Yoga; endowed with which knowledge you shall cast off the bondage of action, O son of Prtha !', ' Here there is no loss due to transgression, and there exists no contrary downward course (sin); even a little of this righteous thing saves [one] from great danger.', ' O source of joy to the Kurus !  The knowledge in the form of determination is just one; [but] the knowledge (thoughts) of those who do not have determination, has many branches and has no end.', ' - 2.43. O son of Prtha ! Those, whose very nature is desire, whose goal is heaven, who esteem only the Vedic declaration [of fruits], who declare that there is nothing else, who proclaim this flowery speech about the paths to the lordship of the objects of enjoyment-[the paths] that are full of different actionsand who desire action alone as a fruit of their birth-they are men without insight.', '2.42. -  O son of Prtha !

Established in the Yoga, perform actions, abandoning attachment, remaining even-minded in success and failure; for, the even-mindedness is said to be the Yoga.', \" O Dhananjaya ! The inferior action stays away at a distance due to Yoga of (one's contact with) determining faculty; in the determining faculty you must seek refuge; wretched are those who constitute the causes for the fruits of action.\", ' Whosoever is endowed with determining faculty-he casts off both of these viz., the good action and the bad action. Therefore strive for Yoga; Yoga is proficiency is action.', ' By renouncing the fruit, born of action, the intelligent ones endowed with determining faculty and freed from the bond of birth, go to the place that is devoid of illness.', ' When your determining faculty goes beyond the impregnable thicket of delusion, at that time you will attain an attitude of futility regarding what has to be heard and what has been heard.', ' When your determining faculty, that had been [earlier] confused by your hearing [of scriptural declaration of fruits] shall stand stable in concentration, at that time you shall attain the Yoga.']\n",
